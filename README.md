# Zero

![Test](https://github.com/philiprbrenan/zero/workflows/Test/badge.svg)

A minimal [assembler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language#Assembler) and [emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator) for the Zero programming language.

The goal is to implement N-Way [trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) in Zero [assembler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language#Assembler) [code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program), optimize the [assembler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language#Assembler) [code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) implementation through exhaustive testing, then realize the
algorithm in silicon hardware rather than software to manufacture large
associative memories on an industrial scale.

Open the __Actions__ [tab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab_key) to see the [code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) in action.
